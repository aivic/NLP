<strong>Morphology</strong> is the study of the way words are built up from the smaller meaning bearing units, <strong>morphemes</strong>.  
A morpheme is defined as the minimal meaning bearing unit in a language.

Morphemes are divided into two classes, <strong>stems</strong> and <strong>affixes</strong>.  

Affixes are themselves divided into 4 sub-classes as -
* prefix - REwrite
* suffix - writeS
* circumfix - REwriteS
* infix - bl**dy (occurs in between the word)

Words can be formed from morphemes in two ways -  

| Inflectional morphology | Derivational morphology |
| ----- | -----|

## 1. Inflectional morphology: 
Inflectional is the combination of a word stem with a grammatical morpheme. E.g. writeS.  
Inflectional can be of two types -
  * an affix that marks plural :- cat | cats, mouse | mice
  * an affix that marks possessive suffix which is realized by apostrophe + s :- He's | children's | goats' 

## 2. Derivational morphology
