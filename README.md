The knowledge in speech and language processing can be divided into six distinct categories -

* Phonetics and Phonology
* Morphology
* Syntax
* Semantics
* Pragmatics
* Discourse

<hr>

Interpretations of each categories -  

* Phonetics and Phonology - Knowledge of how words are pronounced.  
* Morphology - Knowledge about the shape and behaviour of words (like I'm).  
* Syntax - Knowledge needed to order and group words together.  
* Semantics - Knowledge of the meanings of the component words.  
* Pragmatics - Knowledge about the use of kind, polite and indirect language (like I'm sorry).  
* Discourse - Knowledge of correctly structuring overall conversations.
